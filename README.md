# A paraconsistent inference engine to support research in age-related macular degeneration

## Project's description

  <p>
    Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease of the
    macula recognised as the leading cause of vision loss in people over 55. This
    project innovates on AMD prediction analysis through new methods and tools for
    paraconsistent reasoning over complex, weak consistent data classified by often
    contradictory medical judgements. 
    The team fosters synergies between 
    <a href="https://www.inesctec.pt/">INESCTEC</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.aibili.pt/">AIBILI</a>,
    and
    <a href="https://cidma.ua.pt/">UA (CIDMA)</a>.
    The project started in the 1st of Sep. 2025 and will end in the 31st of August
    2028.
