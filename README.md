Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease of the
macula recognised as the leading cause of vision loss in people over 55. This
project innovates on AMD prediction analysis through new methods and tools for
paraconsistent reasoning over complex, weak consistent data classified by often
contradictory medical judgements. The team fosters synergies between INESCTEC,
AIBILI and UA (CIDMA, its Research Center in Maths).

The project started in the 1st of Sep. 2025 and will end in the 31st of August
2028.
